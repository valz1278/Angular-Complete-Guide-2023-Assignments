# Assignment 1: Practicing Components

1. Create two new Components (manually or with CLI): WarningAlert and SuccessAlert
2. Output them beneath each other in the AppComponent
3. Output a warning or success message in the Components
4. Style the Components appropriately (maybe some red/ green text?)
